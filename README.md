# Balanced_Binary_Tree_Demo

This is a demo for introducing balanced binary tree, where an abstract set has been implemented using a linked list and a binary search tree. The code is Standard ML -- you can consider running the code via the [Isabelle theorem prover](https://isabelle.in.tum.de) (i.e., by loadling [Balanced_Binary_Tree_Demo.thy](Balanced_Binary_Tree_Demo.thy) in Isabelle).
